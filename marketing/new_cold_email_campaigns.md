# New Cold Email Campaigns: Speed-to-Lead (Agencies)

 **Goal**: Secure 5 "Founding Partners" for the Speed-to-Lead Install (Free Pilot).
 **Target**: Marketing Agencies ($50k-$500k/mo).

## Campaign 1: The "Secret Shopper" (High Personalization)
*Use this when you have tested their current speed.*

**Subject**: I tested your lead response time
**Subject B**: 48 minutes?

**Body**:
Hey [Name],

I just ran a test on the lead form for [Client Name/Your Agency] to see how fast the follow-up was.

It took **[Time, e.g. 48 minutes]** to get a response. (Or: "I didn't get a text back yet.")

The data shows that waiting just 5 minutes drops conversion rates by 80%. If you're running paid ads, that delay is essentially burning [Ad Spend Amount] before the lead even speaks to a human.

I’m installing a **Sub-5-Second Speed-to-Lead System** for 5 agencies this week as a case study.
- Instant AI Voice Call / SMS
- CRM Auto-Entry
- Team Slack Alert

I'll build it for free ($2,500 value) in exchange for a testimonial.

Open to seeing how it works?

## Campaign 2: The Churn Killer (Retention Angle)
*Targeting owners worried about losing clients.*

**Subject**: Why clients leave (it's not results)
**Subject B**: Client retention

**Body**:
[Name],

The #1 reason clients fire agencies isn't usually "bad ads"—it's "bad leads."

But usually, the leads are fine. The *speed* is the problem. Your client calls them 3 hours later, the lead is cold, and your client says "these leads suck."

I build automated **Speed-to-Lead Engines** that force contact in under 5 seconds.
1. Lead hits form.
2. AI Agent or SMS fires instantly.
3. Your client's phone rings with the prospect on the line.

Suddenly, "bad leads" turn into booked appointments.

I’m looking for 5 "Founding Partners" to install this for free (normally $2,500).

Want to fix the "bad leads" complaint forever?

## Campaign 3: Scale Without Hiring (Capacity Angle)
*Targeting growing agencies.*

**Subject**: Add $50k capacity without hiring
**Subject B**: Your next account manager

**Body**:
Hey [Name],

Most agencies hire more Account Managers to handle lead follow-up. That adds $4k-$6k/mo to overhead.

I help agencies add $50k+ in monthly capacity using **Automation** instead of headcount.

Our Speed-to-Lead install:
- Captures leads instantly.
- Enriches them (Revenue, LinkedIn, Tech Stack).
- Qualifies them via SMS/AI.
- Bookings appear on your calendar.

No sick days. No training. Just booked calls.

I'm gifting the setup (Free Pilot) to the first 5 agencies who reply since I need case studies for my new offer.

Worth a quick chat?

## Follow-up (Reply to any of the above after 2 days)

**Subject**: (Re: previous subject)

**Body**:
Just bumping this, [Name].

I only have capacity for 5 of these free installs (2 spots taken). 

If you're happy with your current lead conversion rates, no worries. But if you want to see what happens when you call leads in 5 seconds vs 50 minutes, let's chat.
