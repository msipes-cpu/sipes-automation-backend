## 1. The "Tech Install" Frame (Adapted from Template 2)
**Subject**: Quick question about [Company] / Automation

Hey [Name],

I run an automation shop out of [Your City]. I know you guys do lead gen/PPC, wanted to run this by you.

To make a long story short: we built a "Speed-to-Lead" system that grabs inbound leads and fires a personalized SMS + calls your sales team in under 5 seconds. It has been crushing—literally doubling conversion rates for agencies because leads never get cold.

I am trying to install this in a few other agencies because I think it has legs. Am extremely confident it'd work for you, so much so that I'd do it **100% free** just to prove it.

Idk what your current response time is, but this ensures it's near-instant 24/7. Would take very little time on your end, I'll do everything else within 72hrs.

If you're open to it just let me know. Can give you a quick ring in the next day or two.

Thanks,
- Michael


## 2. The "Loss Aversion" Frame (Adapted from Template 5)
**Subject**: You are losing leads (technically)

Hey [Name],

Have been following [Company] for a bit—love the work you do in [Niche].

I want to give you some value, because I think I spot a leak.

I used to work in [Relevant Background], and I can say quite confidently that if your team isn't calling leads in <5 minutes, you are likely losing ~50% of your potential deals.

This may be a small sum to you, perhaps not. But I see this all the time and we generally see a 2-4x ROI immediately when we fix it.

Here is my offer: do you want me to fix this for you? I would 100% guarantee I could get your response time to under 10 seconds. It would take next to none of your time, and I'd do it for free as a founding case study.

Just putting this out there. If you're even halfway interested let me know and I can give you a ring.

Best,
- Michael
