# First 5 Clients Campaign Strategy

## 1. Local Objective
**Goal**: Get first 5 clients for "Speed-to-Lead Install" (Free Pilot).
**Target**: Marketing / lead-gen agencies doing $50k–$500k/mo.
**Pain Point**: Complaining about slow follow-up / wasted leads.
**Source**: LinkedIn, Upwork history, Personal network.

## 2. The Hook ("Founding 5" Offer)
> “I’m installing our Speed‑to‑Lead system free for 5 agencies: it grabs every inbound lead, pushes it to your CRM, fires SMS/email + team alert in under 5 seconds. Normal price will be $2,500. You just agree to use it for 30 days, give blunt feedback, and do a testimonial if it clearly makes you money. Fair?”

## 3. Daily Execution (The Rule of 100)
**Every day until you have 5 signed pilots:**
- [ ] **30** Warm reach outs / intro asks (until exhausted)
- [ ] **50** Cold emails to targeted agencies
- [ ] **20** LinkedIn DMs (new + follow-ups)
**Total**: 100 primary actions/day.

## 4. Success Metrics
- **Outreach Volume**: 100/day
- **Engagement Rate**: Shoot for ~3% of outreach turning into engaged leads.
- **Conversion**: 5 Signed Pilots.
