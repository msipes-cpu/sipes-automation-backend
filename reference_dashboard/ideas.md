  **Design Movement**: Cybernetic Brutalism meets Swiss Style
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Data Density**: Information is dense but hierarchically structured, like a pilot's cockpit.
  2. **Raw Functionality**: Exposed grids, monospaced fonts for data, and high contrast for alerts.
  3. **System Transparency**: The UI should feel like looking *into* the machine, not just a skin over it.
  4. **Immediate Feedback**: Every action has an immediate, mechanical visual response.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Space Blue (#0B1120)** as the void/background.
  - **Terminal Green (#10B981)** for healthy systems - signifies "all systems go".
  - **Alert Amber (#F59E0B)** and **Critical Red (#EF4444)** for errors - these should pierce through the dark background like warning lights.
  - **Stark White (#F8FAFC)** for primary data to ensure maximum readability against the dark mode.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Bento Box Grid**: A modular, masonry-style layout where every component lives in a strictly defined rectangular cell.
  - **No Scrolling**: The main dashboard should fit on a single screen (viewport height) whenever possible, like a physical control panel.
  - **Sidebar as Hardware**: The navigation bar should feel like a physical dock, distinct from the screen content.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Scanlines/Grid Backgrounds**: Subtle, low-opacity grid lines behind charts to emphasize precision.
  2. **Monospaced Data**: All numbers, IDs, and timestamps in a high-quality monospace font (e.g., JetBrains Mono or Geist Mono).
  3. **Status Beacons**: Pulsing dots for live/active workflows.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile Clicks**: Buttons should have "depth" when pressed (scale down, shadow shift).
  - **Hover HUDs**: Hovering over a node in a workflow reveals a "Heads Up Display" with detailed stats, rather than a simple tooltip.

  **Animation**:
  - **Glitch/Decode**: Text reveals with a slight decoding effect.
  - **Snap Transitions**: Panels don't fade; they slide and snap into place with mechanical precision.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Space Grotesk** (Bold, uppercase) for a futuristic, industrial feel.
  - **Body/Data**: **Geist Mono** for all data points, logs, and status indicators.
  - **UI Text**: **Inter** (tight tracking) for labels and navigation.

## Response 2: The "Zen Garden" Aesthetic

  **Design Movement**: Soft Minimalism / Neumorphism 2.0
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Calm in Chaos**: Automation can be messy; the dashboard should be the antidote—serene, organized, and quiet.
  2. **Soft Boundaries**: Sections blend into each other using shadows and spacing rather than hard lines.
  3. **Focus on Flow**: Visuals should emphasize the *movement* of data, like water flowing through pipes.
  4. **Human-Centric**: Language and visuals should be warm and approachable, not robotic.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Paper White (#FAFAF9)** and **Warm Gray (#F5F5F4)** backgrounds.
  - **Ethereal Blue (#3B82F6)** for active flows - representing water/energy.
  - **Soft Coral (#F43F5E)** for errors - noticeable but not alarming.
  - **Charcoal (#1C1917)** for text - softer than pure black.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Floating Cards**: Content lives on cards that float above a soft background with diffuse shadows.
  - **Central Focus**: The active workflow takes center stage, with secondary details fading into the periphery.
  - **Generous Whitespace**: Margins are doubled to create a sense of breath and ease.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Glassmorphism**: Subtle blur effects on overlays and sticky headers.
  2. **Rounded Everything**: Super-rounded corners (24px+) on cards and buttons.
  3. **Fluid Connectors**: Workflow lines are curved (bezier), not angled.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Fluidity**: Interactions should feel like moving through water—smooth, damped, and natural.
  - **Gentle Nudges**: Errors appear as soft toasts or inline messages, not jarring modals.

  **Animation**:
  - **Fade & Float**: Elements drift into place.
  - **Pulse**: Active nodes gently pulse like a heartbeat.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Outfit** or **Plus Jakarta Sans** (Medium weight) for a friendly, modern look.
  - **Body**: **Satoshi** or **General Sans** for clean, readable text.

## Response 3: The "Architectural Blueprint" Aesthetic

  **Design Movement**: Technical Technical / Bauhaus
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Structure First**: The underlying logic of the automation is the hero. Show the bones.
  2. **Precision**: Every pixel matters. Alignment is god.
  3. **Contrast & Clarity**: High contrast black and white with a single accent color.
  4. **Documentation as UI**: The interface explains itself. Labels are verbose and descriptive.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Blueprint Blue (#2563EB)** or **International Orange (#EA580C)** as the single accent.
  - **Off-White (#FFFFF0)** background (like drafting paper).
  - **Ink Black (#000000)** for all structural lines and text.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Visible Grids**: The layout grid is visible as thin, light lines, defining the structure.
  - **Split Screen**: Always show the "Map" (workflow) and the "Territory" (logs/data) side-by-side.
  - **Sticky Tools**: Toolbars are anchored to the edges, like a CAD software.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Ruler Lines**: Tick marks and measurement lines on axes.
  2. **Outlined UI**: Buttons and cards are outlined, not filled.
  3. **Technical Icons**: Icons look like drafting symbols.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap-to-Grid**: Dragging and dropping feels magnetic.
  - **Toggle States**: Switches and checkboxes have a satisfying "click" visual.

  **Animation**:
  - **Draw-in**: Lines draw themselves from point A to point B.
  - **Construct**: Panels unfold or slide out like a drawer.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Archivo** (Heavy) for a sturdy, structural feel.
  - **Body**: **IBM Plex Sans** for a technical, engineered look.
  - **Mono**: **IBM Plex Mono** for code and IDs.
