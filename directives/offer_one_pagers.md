## SPEED-TO-LEAD INSTALL
### Never Lose a Lead to Slow Response Times Again

---

### THE PROBLEM

Research shows leads contacted in **5 seconds** convert **400% better** than leads contacted in **5 hours**.

Most marketing agencies respond in hours (not seconds) because:
- Someone has to manually check lead forms
- Someone has to manually enter leads into CRM
- Someone has to manually notify the sales team
- By the time your team responds, the lead has already called your competitor

**If you're closing 10 deals per month at $5k average, and you're losing 30-40% to slow response, that's $15k-$20k in lost monthly revenue.**

---

### THE SOLUTION

We install a system that captures every lead and gets them into your CRM with instant notifications to your team in **under 5 seconds**.

**What we build:**

✓ **Lead Capture**
- Facebook Lead Ads → Instant webhook
- Google Ads leads → Instant webhook
- Website forms → Instant webhook
- Any lead source → Captured automatically

✓ **CRM Sync**
- Auto-sync to your CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, GoHighLevel, etc.)
- Lead tagged with source, campaign, and ad details
- Duplicate detection (no double entries)

✓ **Instant Response**
- Auto-send SMS to lead: "Thanks for your interest! We'll call you in 2 minutes."
- Auto-send email to lead: Personalized based on ad source
- Both sent within 5 seconds of lead submission

✓ **Team Notifications**
- Round-robin assignment to sales team
- Slack/Teams notification with lead details (name, phone, email, source)
- Click-to-call link for instant outreach

✓ **Backup System**
- If no one contacts lead in 15 minutes, manager gets alert
- Ensures no lead falls through the cracks

---

### THE OUTCOME

**You get:**
- Every lead in your CRM automatically (no manual entry)
- Every lead contacted in under 5 seconds (400% better conversion)
- Every lead assigned to the right person (no confusion)
- Zero leads falling through the cracks (backup alerts)

**Your team gets:**
- Instant notifications when leads come in
- All lead details in one place
- No more checking lead forms manually
- No more "I didn't know we had a lead"

**Your leads get:**
- Instant response (builds trust)
- Personal attention (not generic auto-response)
- Fast follow-up (you beat your competitors)

---

### THE ROI

**Time Savings:**
- 20 hours per month saved on manual lead entry and checking
- At $200/hour founder time = $4,000/month value

**Revenue Impact:**
- If you're closing 10 deals/month and losing 30% to slow response
- That's 3 deals lost = $15,000/month in lost revenue
- Even recovering 50% of those = $7,500/month in new revenue

# ONE-PAGER #2: THE 5-CLIENT CAPACITY SYSTEM

---

## THE 5-CLIENT CAPACITY SYSTEM
### Handle 5 More Clients Without Hiring an Operations Manager

---

### THE PROBLEM

Most marketing agencies at $50k-$500k/month hit a **revenue ceiling** not because they can't sell more clients, but because **they can't fulfill without breaking**.

The founder becomes the bottleneck:
- Spending 15+ hours per week on client onboarding
- Manually creating folders, setting up projects, sending emails
- Scrambling to prepare for client calls
- Chasing team members for status updates
- Working nights and weekends just to keep up

**You can sell more, but you can't deliver more without hiring an Operations Manager ($60k-$80k/year) or burning out.**

---

### THE SOLUTION

We install **three core systems** that eliminate the manual work and let you handle 5 more active clients without adding headcount.

---

### SYSTEM 1: CLIENT ONBOARDING AUTOMATION

**The Problem:** Onboarding a new client takes 2-3 hours of manual work (creating folders, setting up CRM, assigning tasks, sending emails).

**What We Build:**

✓ **Trigger:** Contract signed in DocuSign/PandaDoc/HelloSign

✓ **Automatic Actions:**
- Create project folder structure (Google Drive/Dropbox)
- Create Slack/Teams channel and invite team + client
- Add client to CRM with proper tags and pipeline stage
- Create project board (ClickUp/Asana/Monday) with template tasks
- Assign tasks to team members based on service type
- Send welcome email sequence (Day 1, Day 3, Day 7)
- Schedule kickoff call and send calendar invite
- Create client portal access (if applicable)

✓ **Outcome:** New client goes from "contract signed" to "fully onboarded" in 5 minutes instead of 3 hours.

---

### SYSTEM 2: SPEED-TO-LEAD RESPONSE

**The Problem:** Leads sit for hours before someone manually enters them into CRM and notifies the sales team.

**What We Build:**

✓ **Lead Capture:**
- Facebook/Google/Website leads → Instant webhook

✓ **CRM Sync:**
- Auto-sync to CRM with source tracking

✓ **Instant Response:**
- Auto-send SMS + Email to lead (under 5 seconds)

✓ **Team Notifications:**
- Round-robin assignment to sales team
- Slack/Teams notification with lead details

✓ **Backup System:**
- Alert if no contact made in 15 minutes

✓ **Outcome:** Every lead gets contacted in under 5 seconds. You stop losing deals to slow response.

---

### SYSTEM 3: CLIENT COMMUNICATION HUB

**The Problem:** Preparing for client calls, sending status updates, and following up takes 5+ hours per week.

**What We Build:**

✓ **Weekly Status Updates:**
- Auto-pull data from project board (tasks completed, in progress, blocked)
- Auto-generate status email
- Auto-send to client every Friday at 5pm
- No manual work required

✓ **Meeting Prep Assistant:**
- Before every client call, auto-pull client info from CRM
- Recent activity, open tasks, notes from last call
- Send prep sheet to your Slack/Email 1 hour before call
- You show up prepared, every time

✓ **Automated Follow-Ups:**
- After client calls, auto-create follow-up tasks
- Auto-send recap email with action items
- Auto-schedule next meeting

✓ **Outcome:** Client communication happens automatically. You're never scrambling.

---

### THE OUTCOME

**You get:**
- 40+ hours per month back (15h onboarding + 20h lead response + 5h communication)
- Ability to handle 5 more clients without hiring
- No more working nights and weekends
- Time to focus on sales and strategy (not admin)

**Your team gets:**
- Clear task assignments (no more "what should I be doing?")
- Automatic notifications (no more checking 5 tools)
- Consistent processes (no more "how do we do this again?")

**Your clients get:**
- Smooth onboarding experience (professional, not chaotic)
- Fast response times (5 seconds, not 5 hours)
- Regular communication (status updates without asking)

---

### THE ROI

**Time Savings:**
- 40 hours per month saved on manual work
- At $200-$500/hour founder time = $8,000-$20,000/month value

**Revenue Impact:**
- Ability to take on 5 more clients at $2,000/month average = $10,000/month
- Or: Ability to close 3 more deals per month at $5,000 average = $15,000/month

**Avoided Hiring Cost:**
- Operations Manager salary: $60,000-$80,000/year
- You're paying $4,997 once instead

**Total Value:** $18,000-$35,000/month = $216,000-$420,000/year

**Your Investment:** $4,997 one-time
