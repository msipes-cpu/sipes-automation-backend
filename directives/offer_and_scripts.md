## Outbound Script (Email & LinkedIn)
**Subject**: Quick question about your lead response times

**Body**:
Hey [Name],

Saw you run [Company] – looks like you’re driving a lot of inbound traffic.

Most agencies we talk to are still taking 10–60 minutes (or more) to call new leads, even though the data’s clear: respond in under 5 minutes and you get 2–4x the conversions.

I build “speed‑to‑lead” systems that grab every lead, push it into your CRM, and trigger instant SMS + team alerts in under 5 seconds.

I’m taking on 5 agencies to install this for free in exchange for feedback and a testimonial if it performs. Normal price will be $2,500.

Worth 15 minutes to see if we can plug any leaks in your current follow‑up?

Best,
