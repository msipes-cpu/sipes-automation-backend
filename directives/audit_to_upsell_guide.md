# Audit-to-Upsell Bridge Script

**Goal**: Convert the "Free Pilot" usage into a **$2,500** or **$5k** deal using your One-Pagers.

## Phase 1: The Audit Call (The Setup)
*You are not selling here. You are diagnosing.*

**You**: "Okay, I've mapped out your current intake process. It looks like you're losing about 3-4 hours a week just on data entry here."
**You**: "For the Free Pilot, I'm going to automate just this *one* slice—the `Intake Form -> CRM` step—so you can feel what it's like to have that time back."

*(Build the automation. Let them use it for 3-5 days.)*

## Phase 2: The "Pilot Review" Call (The Pivot)
*This is where you switch from 'Free Guy' to 'Expert Consultant'.*

**You**: "So, the intake automation has been running for a week. The data is hitting your CRM instantly. How does that feel compared to the old way?"
**Probe**: "Have you noticed you aren't chasing emails as much?"

**The Bridge**:
"Here's the thing. Fixing the *Intake Form* is great, it saved you maybe 3 hours. But while looking at your process, I saw two other massive bottlenecks that are costing you way more money:
1.  **Lead Response Time**: You're still calling leads hours later. (Speed-to-Lead problem).
2.  **Onboarding Chaos**: Once they sign, you're scrambling to set up folders. (Capacity problem)."

"I built a 'One-Pager' for exactly how to fix those larger issues. Can I share my screen?"

## Phase 3: The Pitch (Show the One-Pager)

*(Pull up the `Speed-to-Lead` or `5-Client Capacity` One-Pager targeting their specific pain)*

**You**: "This is the **5-Client Capacity System**. It's designed to solve exactly what we saw in your audit: the chaos after the contract is signed."
**You**: "It handles Onboarding, Speed-to-Lead, and Client Comms automatically."
**You**: "Normally, to implement this custom would be $10k+. But I offer it as a fixed-scope install for **$4,997**."

**The Close**:
"Since you're already in my Pilot program, I can credit the work we've already done. If you want to upgrade to the full system today, we can just roll right into it."

## Decision Matrix
- **If they are small/sales-focused**: Pitch **Speed-to-Lead ($2,500)**.
- **If they are drowning in operations**: Pitch **5-Client Capacity ($4,997)**.
