# Directive: SaaS Promotion on X (Value-First Strategy)

## Goal
To promote a SaaS startup on X (formerly Twitter) for 30 days without appearing overly "salesy." The objective is to build trust, authority, and a community by providing genuine value, education, and behind-the-scenes transparency ("Building in Public").

## Core Principles
1.  **Value > Ask**: Give 90% of the time; ask 10% of the time.
2.  **Edu-tainment**: Teach something useful but keep it engaging.
3.  **Build in Public**: Show the messy process, not just the polished result. Vulnerability builds trust.
4.  **Engagement**: Treat replies as a "public CRM." Conversation is where the conversion happens.
5.  **Dwell Time is King**: The new algorithm favors posts that keep people reading/viewing longer.
6.  **Media is Mandatory**: Posts with images/video get 5x-10x more impressions.
7.  **Raw > Polished**: Don't overthink. Authentic, simple text often wins.

## Execution Guidelines
*   **Hooks are King**: The first line of your post must grab attention. Use numbers, strong statements, or questions. STRICT character limit for the hook (under 280 chars).
*   **Narratives = Threads**: If you are telling a personal story or explaining a complex problem, break it into a **Thread**. Do not try to cram it into one post.
*   **Tone**: Be **Helpful**, not Salesy. Focus on the value provided and the problem solved. The goal is to educate, not just pitch.
*   **Visuals**: Every post should generally have an image, GIF, or video.
*   **Threads**: Use threads for "Deep Dives", "Narratives", or "How-To" content.
*   **Formatting**: Use line breaks, emojis (sparingly but effectively), and clear structure.

## Getting Started Checklist (Prerequisites)

Before posting Day 1, ensure you have the following ready:

### 1. Profile Optimization ("The Landing Page")
*   **Bio**: Clear value prop. Formula: "Helping [Target Audience] achieve [Benefit] with [Product]. Building in public."
*   **Header Image**: Visual representation of your SaaS or a clean tagline. Not just abstract art.
*   **Pinned Tweet**: Alternatively, a "Start Here" thread that explains your story and links to your waitlist/product.

### 2. Asset Collection
*   [ ] **Screenshots**: Take 10+ clean screenshots of your product UI.
*   [ ] **Recordings**: Create 3-5 short GIFs or screen recordings of key features.
*   [ ] **Founder Photos**: 1-2 decent photos of yourself (humanizes the brand).

### 3. Tool Stack Recommendation
*   **Scheduling**: Typefully or Hypefury (Best for writing threads and "auto-plugging" offers).
*   **Design**: Canva or Figma for simple visuals.
*   **Screen Capture**: CleanShot X (Mac) or Loom for slick recordings.

## 100x Growth Strategy ("Supercharge It")
To move from "doing it right" to "going viral," implement these advanced tactics:

### 1. Engineer Virality (The "Side Project" Strategy)
Don't just post content; launch mini-tools.
*   **Tactic**: Build a simple, free tool related to your main SaaS (e.g., a "Headline Generator" if you sell an SEO tool).
*   **Launch**: Launch it on X with a high-production video.
*   **Why**: Tools get 100x more retweets than blog posts.

### 2. "Unhinged" Marketing
Break the corporate pattern.
*   **Tactic**: Post memes, roast bad industry practices, or share "scary" transparency (e.g., "We almost went broke last week").
*   **Why**: The algorithm rewards high emotion (shock, humor, relatable pain).

### 3. The "Reply Guy" Method (DEPRECATED based on 2026 Algo)
*   *Note: This is less effective now as the algorithm prioritizes content quality over early engagement.*
*   **Tactic**: Only use this for networking, not for algorithmic growth.

### 4. Direct MMs -> Loom Video
*   **Tactic**: When someone engages deeply, DM them a *personal* 30-second Loom video greeting. "Hey, saw you liked the post on X, just wanted to say hi."
*   **Why**: No one does this. It builds super-fans instantly.

### 5. Media-First Strategy (New Algo)
*   **Tactic**: Every single post must have a relevant image, chart, or screenshot.
*   **Why**: Images increase dwell time. Dwell time = Impressions.
*   **Note**: Even a simple photo of your screen or a meme works. Don't post text-only unless it's a very short hook.

### 5. The "Giveaway" Loop
*   **Tactic**: "I spent 100 hours building this [valuable database/list]. Retweet and I'll DM it to you."
*   **Automation**: Use a tool like TweetHunter or Hypefury to auto-DM people who retweet.
*   **Result**: Massive algorithmic boost due to high comment/retweet ratio.
