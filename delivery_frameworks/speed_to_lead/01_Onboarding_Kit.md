## 2. Kickoff Call Script (30 Minutes)

**Agenda:**
1.  **Access Check:** Verifying logins work.
2.  **Logic Check:** Who gets the leads?
3.  **Content Check:** What do the messages say?

**The Script:**

**[Intro - 2 mins]**
"Goal of today is simple: I want to make sure I understand exactly how you want leads handled so I can build it right the first time. We'll be done in 30 mins."

**[Access Verification - 5 mins]**
"I see you submitted the form. I'm going to test the CRM login right now... Okay, I'm in. Now checking Facebook Ad Account access... Great, I see it."
*(If access fails, resolve NOW. Do not end call until you have access.)*

**[Routing Logic - 10 mins]**
"When a lead comes in...
- Do you want it to go to *everyone* at once? (Blast)
- Or *one person* at a time? (Round-robin)
- If Round-robin: Who is first? Who is second?
- If no one answers in 15 mins, who is the 'Manager' that gets the angry notification?"

**[Message Copy - 10 mins]**
"We have our standard high-converting templates:
SMS: *'Thanks for inquiring! This is [Name] with [Company]. I'm reviewing your info now and will call in 2 mins.'*
- Do you want to use this, or your own customization?"
*(Note: Keep them to the standard if possible to ensure speed deployment).*

**[Close - 3 mins]**
"Awesome. I have everything I need. I'm going to start the build this afternoon. Expect to hear from me on [Day 3] for the Handoff Call where we'll test it live. Any questions?"
