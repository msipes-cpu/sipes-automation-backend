## 1. How It Works (Cheat Sheet)

### The Flow
1.  **Lead Enters:** (From FB, Google, Website).
2.  **Instant Ack:** Lead gets SMS ("Calling you in 2 mins") + Email.
3.  **Team Alert:** Your team gets Slack/SMS notification.
4.  **Auto-Assign:** Lead is assigned to a Rep in the CRM.
5.  **Backup:** If status isn't changed in 15 mins, Manager is alerted.

### What You Need To Do
*   **When you get a lead:** CALL IMMEDIATELY. The lead is expecting it (we told them 2 mins).
*   **In the CRM:** You **MUST** move the lead out of "New Lead" stage after you call them.
    *   *If you leave it in "New Lead", the Backup Alert will fire and annoy your manager.*

## 2. Common Scenarios

**Scenario A: "I want to change the SMS message."**
*   **Instructions:** Go to [Tool Name - e.g. HighLevel/Make] -> Workflow "Speed Response" -> Edit SMS Step.
*   *Warning:* Keep it short. Long texts get filtered by carriers.

**Scenario B: "A new salesperson joined."**
*   **Instructions:** Email support@sipesautomation.com or update the "Round Robin" variable in [Tool Name].

**Scenario C: "We are getting spam leads."**
*   **Instructions:** The system processes all form fills. We can add a filter steps later if needed, but for now, mark them as "Lost/Spam" in CRM.
